# [Find Job](https://mdafsarhossain-find-job.surge.sh/)

`Find Job` designed to help users easily discover and apply for jobs across various categories such as `onsite`, `remote`, `full-time`, `part-time`, and `hybrid`. Users can apply for as many jobs as they wish, with each application triggering a toast notification and saving the job ID in the browser's `local storage`. This allows them to view their applied jobs even after returning to the site later. The `Applied Jobs` section also features filters based on job type, making it easier to manage applications. We're currently working on a `blog section`, which will be added in the future.

## Key Features:

- `Job Categories:` Offers a wide range of job options, including onsite, remote, full-time, part-time, and hybrid roles.
- `Unlimited Applications:` Users can apply for as many jobs as they want.
- `Toast Notifications:` Instant toast messages confirm successful job applications.
- `Local Storage:` Applied jobs are saved in the user's browser, allowing them to see their applications even after returning to the site later.
- `Applied Jobs Section:` A dedicated section where users can view and manage their applied jobs.
- `Job Filtering:` Users can filter their applied jobs based on job type (onsite, remote, full-time, part-time, hybrid).
- `Responsive Design:` The site is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across platforms.
- `Future Blog Section:` A blog section is planned to offer additional content related to job searches and career advice.
